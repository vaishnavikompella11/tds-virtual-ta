You would have used most of these before. If most of this is new to you, please take this course later. Some tools are fundamental to data science because they are industry standards and widely used by data science professionals. Mastering these tools will align you with current best practices and making you more adaptable in a fast-evolving industry. The tools we cover here are not just popular, they\u2019re the core technology behind most of today\u2019s data science and software development.

LLMs incur a cost. For the May 2025 batch, use aipipe.org as a proxy. Emails with @ds.study.iitm.ac.in get a $1 per calendar month allowance. (Don\u2019t exceed that.) Read the AI Pipe documentation to learn how to use it. But in short: Replace OPENAI_BASE_URL, i.e. https://api.openai.com/v1 with https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1... or https://aipipe.org/openai/v1... Replace OPENAI_API_KEY with the AIPIPE_TOKEN Replace model names, e.g. gpt-4.1-nano, with openai/gpt-4.1-nano For example, let\u2019s use Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite via OpenRouter for chat completions and Text Embedding 3 Small via OpenAI for embeddings: ``` curl https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1/chat/completions \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $AIPIPE_TOKEN\" \\ -d '{ \"model\": \"google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001\", \"messages\": [{ \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is 2 + 2?\"} }] }' curl https://aipipe.org/openai/v1/embeddings \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $AIPIPE_TOKEN\" \\ -d '{ \"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\", \"input\": \"What is 2 + 2?\" }'Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Or using llm: ``` llm keys set openai --value $AIPIPE_TOKEN export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1 llm 'What is 2 + 2?' -m openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001 export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://aipipe.org/openai/v1 llm embed -c 'What is 2 + 2' -m 3-smallCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` For a 50% discount (but slower speed), use Flex processing by adding service_tier: \"flex\" to your JSON request. AI Proxy - Jan 2025 For the Jan 2025 batch, we had created API keys for everyone with an iitm.ac.in email to use gpt-4o-mini and text-embedding-3-small. Your usage is limited to $1 per calendar month for this course. Don\u2019t exceed that. Use AI Proxy instead of OpenAI. Specifically: Replace your API to https://api.openai.com/... with https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/... Replace the OPENAI_API_KEY with the AIPROXY_TOKEN that someone will give you.

And what we are going to cover in this module is how you get the data. There are three ways you can get the data. The first is you can download the data. Either somebody gives you the data and says download it from here, or you are asked to download it from the internet because it\u2019s a public data source. But that\u2019s the first way\u2014you download the data. The second way is you can query it from somewhere. It may be on a database. It may be available through an API. It may be available through a library. But these are ways in which you can selectively query parts of the data and stitch it together. The third way is you have to scrape it. It\u2019s not directly available in a convenient form that you can query or download. But it is, in fact, on a web page. It\u2019s available on a PDF file. It\u2019s available in a Word document. It\u2019s available on an Excel file. It\u2019s kind of structured, but you will have to figure out that structure and extract it from there. In this module, we will be looking at the tools that will help you either download from a data source or query from an API or from a database or from a library. And finally, how you can scrape from different sources.

Google Auth is the most commonly implemented single sign-on mechanism because: It\u2019s popular and user-friendly. Users can log in with their existing Google accounts. It\u2019s secure: Google supports OAuth2 and OpenID Connect to handle authentication. Here\u2019s how you build a FastAPI app that identifies the user. Go to the Google Cloud Console \u2013 Credentials and click Create Credentials > OAuth client ID. Choose Web application, set your authorized redirect URIs (e.g., http://localhost:8000/). Copy the Client ID and Client Secret into a .env file: GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secretCopy to clipboardErrorCopied 4. Create your FastAPI app.py: ``` /// script dependencies = [\"python-dotenv\", \"fastapi\", \"uvicorn\", \"itsdangerous\", \"httpx\", \"authlib\"] /// import os from dotenv import load_dotenv from fastapi import FastAPI, Request from fastapi.responses import RedirectResponse from starlette.middleware.sessions import SessionMiddleware from authlib.integrations.starlette_client import OAuth load_dotenv() app = FastAPI() app.add_middleware(SessionMiddleware, secret_key=\"create-a-random-secret-key\") oauth = OAuth() oauth.register( name=\"google\", client_id=os.getenv(\"GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID\"), client_secret=os.getenv(\"GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET\"), server_metadata_url=\"https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration\", client_kwargs={\"scope\": \"openid email profile\"}, ) @app.get(\"/\") async def application(request: Request): user = request.session.get(\"user\") # 3.

It\u2019s essential when you need to transmit binary data through text-only channels or embed binary content in text formats. Watch this quick explanation of how Base64 works (3 min): Here\u2019s how it works: It takes 3 bytes (24 bits) and converts them into 4 ASCII characters \u2026 using 64 characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, + and / (padding with = to make the length a multiple of 4) There\u2019s a URL-safe variant of Base64 that replaces + and / with - and _ to avoid issues in URLs Base64 adds ~33% overhead (since every 3 bytes becomes 4 characters) Common Python operations with Base64: ``` import base64 Basic encoding/decoding text = \"Hello, World!\" Convert text to base64 encoded = base64.b64encode(text.encode()).decode() # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ== Convert base64 back to text decoded = base64.b64decode(encoded).decode() # Hello, World! Convert to URL-safe base64 url_safe = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(text.encode()).decode() # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ== Working with binary files (e.g., images) with open('image.png', 'rb') as f: binary_data = f.read() image_b64 = base64.b64encode(binary_data).decode() Data URI example (embed images in HTML/CSS) data_uri = f\"data:image/png;base64,{image_b64}\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Data URIs allow embedding binary data directly in HTML/CSS. This reduces the number of HTTP requests and also works offline. But it increases the file size. For example, here\u2019s an SVG image embedded as a data URI: <img src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAzMiAzMiI+PGNpcmNsZSBjeD0iMTYiIGN5PSIxNiIgcj0iMTUiIGZpbGw9IiMyNTYzZWIiLz48cGF0aCBmaWxsPSIjZmZmIiBkPSJtMTYgNyAyIDcgNyAyLTcgMi0yIDctMi03LTctMiA3LTJaIi8+PC9zdmc+\" />Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Base64 is used in many places: JSON: Encoding binary data in JSON payloads Email: MIME attachments encoding Auth: HTTP Basic Authentication headers JWT: Encoding tokens in web authentication SSL/TLS: PEM certificate format SAML: Encoding assertions in SSO Git: Encoding binary files in patches Tools for working with Base64: Base64 Decoder/Encoder for online encoding/decoding data: URI Generator converts files to Data URIs [Previous LLM Text Extraction](#/llm-text-extraction) [Next Vision Models](#/vision-models)",

Combined Crawling and Conversion Sometimes you need to both crawl a website and convert its content to markdown or text in a single workflow, like Crawl4AI or markdown-crawler. For research/data collection: Use a specialized crawler (like Crawl4AI) with post-processing conversion For simple website archiving: Markdown-crawler provides a convenient all-in-one solution For high-quality conversion: Use wget/wget2 for crawling followed by pandoc for conversion For maximum speed: Combine wget with lynx in a pipeline Crawl4AI Crawl4AI is designed for single-page extraction with high-quality content processing. Crawl4AI is optimized for AI training data extraction, focusing on clean, structured content rather than complete site preservation.

This tutorial explores various command-line tools for converting PDFs to Markdown format, with a focus on preserving structure and formatting suitable for different use cases, including preparation for Large Language Models (LLMs). Use Cases: LLM training and fine-tuning: Create clean text data from PDFs for AI model training Knowledge base creation: Transform PDFs into searchable, editable markdown documents Content repurposing: Convert academic papers and reports for web publication Data extraction: Pull structured content from PDF documents for analysis Accessibility: Convert PDFs to more accessible formats for screen readers Citation and reference management: Extract bibliographic information from academic papers Documentation conversion: Transform technical PDFs into maintainable documentation PyMuPDF4LLM PyMuPDF4LLM is a specialized component of the PyMuPDF library that generates Markdown specifically formatted for Large Language Models. It produces high-quality markdown with good preservation of document structure. It\u2019s specifically optimized for producing text that works well with LLMs, removing irrelevant formatting while preserving semantic structure. Requires PyTorch, which adds dependencies but enables more advanced processing capabilities. PyMuPDF4LLM uses MuPDF as its PDF parsing engine. PyMuPDF is emerging as a strong default for PDF text extraction due to its accuracy and performance in handling complex PDF structures.

It\u2019s a versatile multi-format converter that handles PDFs via PDFMiner, DOCX via Mammoth, XLSX via Pandas, and PPTX via Python-PPTX. Good for batch processing of mixed document types. The quality of PDF conversion is generally good but may struggle with complex layouts or heavily formatted documents. PYTHONUTF8=1 uvx markitdown $FILE.pdf > markitdown.mdCopy to clipboardErrorCopied PYTHONUTF8=1: Forces Python to use UTF-8 encoding uvx markitdown: Runs the markitdown tool via the uv package manager $FILE.pdf: The input PDF file > markitdown.md: Redirects output to a markdown file Unstructured Unstructured is rapidly becoming the de facto library for parsing over 40 different file types. It is excellent for extracting text and tables from diverse document formats. Particularly useful for generating clean content to pass to LLMs. Strong community support and actively maintained. GROBID If you specifically need to parse references from text-native PDFs or reliably OCR\u2019ed ones, GROBID remains the de facto choice.

You\u2019ll often access databases created by others for analysis. PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS SQL, Oracle, etc. are popular databases. But the most installed database is SQLite. It\u2019s embedded into many devices and apps (e.g. your phone, browser, etc.). It\u2019s lightweight but very scalable and powerful. Watch these introductory videos to understand SQLite and how it\u2019s used in Python (34 min): There are many non-relational databases (NoSQL) like ElasticSearch, MongoDB, Redis, etc. that you should know about and we may cover later.

These are like a map of text in numerical form. Each number represents a feature, and similar texts will have numbers close to each other. So, if the numbers are similar, the text they represent mean something similar. This is useful because text similarity is important in many common problems: Search. Find similar documents to a query. Classification. Classify text into categories. Clustering. Group similar items into clusters. Anomaly Detection. Find an unusual piece of text. You can run embedding models locally or using an API. Local models are better for privacy and cost. APIs are better for scale and quality. | Feature | Local Models | API | | --- | --- | --- | | Privacy | High | Dependent on provider | | Cost | High setup, low after that | Pay-as-you-go | | Scale | Limited by local resources | Easily scales with demand | | Quality | Varies by model | Typically high | The Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) provides comprehensive comparisons of embedding models. These models are compared on several parameters, but here are some key ones to look at: Rank. Higher ranked models have higher quality. Memory Usage. Lower is better (for similar ranks). It costs less and is faster to run. Embedding Dimensions. Lower is better. This is the number of numbers in the array. Smaller dimensions are cheaper to store. Max Tokens. Higher is better. This is the number of input tokens (words) the model can take in a single input. Look for higher scores in the columns for Classification, Clustering, Summarization, etc. based on your needs. Local Embeddings Here\u2019s a minimal example using a local embedding model: ``` /// script requires-python = \"==3.12\" dependencies = [ \"sentence-transformers\", \"httpx\", \"numpy\", ] /// from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer import numpy as np model = SentenceTransformer('BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5') # A small, high quality model async def embed(text: str) -> list[float]: \"\"\"Get embedding vector for text using local model.\"\"\" return model.encode(text).tolist() async def get_similarity(text1: str, text2: str) -> float: \"\"\"Calculate cosine similarity between two texts.\"\"\" emb1 = np.array(await embed(text1)) emb2 = np.array(await embed(text2)) return float(np.dot(emb1, emb2) / (np.linalg.norm(emb1) * np.linalg.norm(emb2))) async def main(): print(await get_similarity(\"Apple\", \"Orange\")) print(await get_similarity(\"Apple\", \"Lightning\")) if name == \"main\": import asyncio asyncio.run(main())Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Note the get_similarity function. It uses a Cosine Similarity to calculate the similarity between two embeddings. OpenAI Embeddings For comparison, here\u2019s how to use OpenAI\u2019s API with direct HTTP calls. Replace the embed function in the earlier script: ``` import os import httpx async def embed(text: str) -> list[float]: \"\"\"Get embedding vector for text using OpenAI's API.\"\"\" async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client: response = await client.post( \"https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings\", headers={\"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']}\"}, json={\"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\", \"input\": text} ) return response.json()[\"data\"][0][\"embedding\"]Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` NOTE: You need to set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable for this to work.

Gemini transcription The Gemini models from Google are notable in two ways: They have a huge input context window. Gemini 2.0 Flash can accept 1M tokens, for example. They can handle audio input. This allows us to use Gemini to transcribe audio files. LLMs are not good at transcribing audio faithfully. They tend to correct errors and meander from what was said. But they are intelligent. That enables a few powerful workflows. Here are some examples: Transcribe into other languages. Gemini will handle the transcription and translation in a single step. Summarize audio transcripts. For example, convert a podcast into a tutorial, or a meeting recording into actions. Legal Proceeding Analysis. Extract case citations, dates, and other details from a legal debate.

This is perfect for building chatbots and AI assistants that need to interact with your backend systems. OpenAI supports Function Calling \u2013 a way for LLMs to suggest what functions to call and how. Here\u2019s a minimal example using Python and OpenAI\u2019s function calling that identifies the weather in a given location. ``` /// script requires-python = \">=3.11\" dependencies = [ \"httpx\", ] /// import httpx import os from typing import Dict, Any def query_gpt(user_input: str, tools: list[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, Any]: response = httpx.post( \"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\", headers={ \"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')}\", \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\", }, json={ \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini\", \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_input}], \"tools\": tools, \"tool_choice\": \"auto\", }, ) return response.json()[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"] WEATHER_TOOL = { \"type\": \"function\", \"function\": { \"name\": \"get_weather\", \"description\": \"Get the current weather for a location\", \"parameters\": { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"location\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"City name or coordinates\"} }, \"required\": [\"location\"], \"additionalProperties\": False, }, \"strict\": True, }, } if name == \"main\": response = query_gpt(\"What is the weather in San Francisco?\", [WEATHER_TOOL]) print([tool_call[\"function\"] for tool_call in response[\"tool_calls\"]])Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` How to define functions The function definition is a JSON schema with a few OpenAI specific properties.

By mixing exact text matches with embedding-based similarity, you get the best of both worlds: precision when keywords are present, and semantic recall when phrasing varies. TypeSense makes this easy with built-in hybrid search and automatic embedding generation. Below is a fully self-contained Hybrid RAG tutorial using TypeSense, Python, and the command line. Install and run TypeSense Install TypeSense. ``` mkdir typesense-data docker run -p 8108:8108 \\ -v typesense-data:/data typesense/typesense:28.0 \\ --data-dir /data \\ --api-key=secret-key \\ --enable-corsCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` docker run: spins up a containerized TypeSense server on port 8108 -p 8108:8108 maps host port to container port. -v typesense-data:/data mounts a Docker volume for persistence. --data-dir /data points TypeSense at that volume. --api-key=secret-key secures your API. --enable-cors allows browser-based requests. Expected output: Docker logs showing TypeSense startup messages, such as Started Typesense API server. Listening on http://0.0.0.0:8108. Embed and import documents into TypeSense Follow the steps in the RAG with the CLI tutorial to create a chunks.json that has one {id, content} JSON object per line. TypeSense supports automatic embedding of documents. We\u2019ll use that capability. Save the following as addnotes.py and run it with uv run addnotes.py. ``` /// script requires-python = \">=3.13\" dependencies = [\"httpx\"] /// import json import httpx import os headers = {\"X-TYPESENSE-API-KEY\": \"secret-key\"} schema = { \"name\": \"notes\", \"fields\": [ {\"name\": \"id\", \"type\": \"string\", \"facet\": False}, {\"name\": \"content\", \"type\": \"string\", \"facet\": False}, { \"name\": \"embedding\", \"type\": \"float[]\", \"embed\": { \"from\": [\"content\"], \"model_config\": { \"model_name\": \"openai/text-embedding-3-small\", \"api_key\": os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"), }, }, }, ], } with open(\"chunks.json\", \"r\") as f: chunks = [json.loads(line) for line in f.readlines()] with httpx.Client() as client: # Create the collection if client.get(f\"http://localhost:8108/collections/notes\", headers=headers).status_code == 404: r = client.post(\"http://localhost:8108/collections\", json=schema, headers=headers) # Embed the chunks result = client.post( \"http://localhost:8108/collections/notes/documents/import?action=emplace\", headers={**headers, \"Content-Type\": \"text/plain\"}, data=\"\\n\".join(json.dumps(chunk) for chunk in chunks), ) print(result.text)Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` httpx.Client: an HTTP client for Python. Collection schema: id and content fields plus an embedding field with auto-generated embeddings from OpenAI. Auto-embedding: the embed block instructs TypeSense to call the specified model for each document. GET /collections/notes: checks existence. POST /collections: creates the collection. POST /collections/notes/documents/import?action=emplace: bulk upsert documents, embedding them on the fly. Expected output: A JSON summary string like {\"success\": X, \"failed\": 0} indicating how many docs were imported. (On timeouts, re-run until all chunks are processed.) 4.

Often, pages have dozens of images. Image analysis runs over thousands of images. The cost of storage and bandwidth can grow over time. Here are things you should know when you\u2019re compressing images: Image dimensions are the width and height of the image in pixels. This impacts image size a lot Lossless compression (PNG, WebP) preserves exact data Lossy compression (JPEG, WebP) removes some data for smaller files Vector formats (SVG) scale without quality loss WebP is the modern standard, supporting both lossy and lossless Here\u2019s a rule of thumb you can use as of 2025. Use SVG if you can (i.e. if it\u2019s vector graphics or you can convert it to one) Else, reduce the image to as small as you can, and save as (lossy or lossless) WebP Common operations with Python: ``` from pathlib import Path from PIL import Image import io async def compress_image(input_path: Path, output_path: Path, quality: int = 85) -> None: \"\"\"Compress an image while maintaining reasonable quality.\"\"\" with Image.open(input_path) as img: # Convert RGBA to RGB if needed if img.mode == 'RGBA': img = img.convert('RGB') # Optimize for web img.save(output_path, 'WEBP', quality=quality, optimize=True) Batch process images paths = Path('images').glob('*.jpg') for p in paths: await compress_image(p, p.with_suffix('.webp'))Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Command line tools include cwebp, pngquant, jpegoptim, and ImageMagick. ``` Convert to WebP cwebp -q 85 input.png -o output.webp Optimize PNG pngquant --quality=65-80 image.png Optimize JPEG jpegoptim --strip-all --all-progressive --max=85 image.jpg Convert and resize convert input.jpg -resize 800x600 output.jpg Batch convert mogrify -format webp -quality 85 *.jpgCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Watch this video on modern image formats and optimization (15 min): Tools for image optimization: squoosh.app: Browser-based compression ImageOptim: GUI tool for Mac sharp: Node.js image processing Pillow: Python imaging library [Previous Markdown](#/markdown) [Next Static hosting: GitHub Pages](#/github-pages)",

Unlike simple prompt-response patterns, agents make multiple LLM calls, use tools, and adapt their approach based on intermediate results. They represent a significant step toward more autonomous AI systems. What Makes an Agent? An LLM agent consists of three core components: LLM Brain: Makes decisions about what to do next Tools: External capabilities the agent can use (e.g., web search, code execution) Memory: Retains context across multiple steps Agents operate through a loop: Observe the environment Think about what to do Take action using tools Observe results Repeat until task completion Command-Line Agent Example We\u2019ve created a minimal command-line agent called llm-cmd-agent.py that: Takes a task description from the command line Generates code to accomplish the task Automatically extracts and executes the code Passes the results back to the LLM Provides a final answer or tries again if the execution fails Here\u2019s how it works: uv run llm-cmd-agent.py \"list all Python files under the current directory, recursively, by size\" uv run llm-cmd-agent.py \"convert the largest Markdown file to HTML\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied The agent will: Generate a shell script to list files with their sizes Execute the script in a subprocess Capture the output (stdout and stderr) Pass the output back to the LLM for interpretation Present a final answer to the user Under the hood, the agent follows this workflow: Initial prompt to generate a shell script Code extraction from the LLM response Code execution in a subprocess Result interpretation by the LLM Error handling and retry logic if needed This demonstrates the core agent loop of: Planning (generating code) Execution (running the code) Reflection (interpreting results) Adaptation (fixing errors if needed) Agent Architectures Different agent architectures exist for different use cases: ReAct (Reasoning + Acting): Interleaves reasoning steps with actions Reflexion: Adds self-reflection to improve reasoning MRKL (Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language): Combines neural and symbolic modules Plan-and-Execute: Creates a plan first, then executes steps Real-World Applications LLM agents can be applied to various domains: Research assistants that search, summarize, and synthesize information Coding assistants that write, debug, and explain code Data analysis agents that clean, visualize, and interpret data Customer service agents that handle queries and perform actions Personal assistants that manage schedules, emails, and tasks Project Ideas Here are some practical agent projects you could build: Study buddy agent: Helps create flashcards, generates practice questions, and explains concepts Job application assistant: Searches job listings, tailors resumes, and prepares interview responses Personal finance agent: Categorizes expenses, suggests budgets, and identifies savings opportunities Health and fitness coach: Creates workout plans, tracks nutrition, and provides motivation Course project helper: Breaks down assignments, suggests resources, and reviews work Best Practices Clear instructions: Define the agent\u2019s capabilities and limitations Effective tool design: Create tools that are specific and reliable Robust error handling: Agents should recover gracefully from failures Memory",

Example: Sifting through server logs in JSON Lines format to extract error messages or aggregate metrics without launching a full-scale ETL process. ``` Extract specific fields from JSONL cat data.jsonl | jq -c 'select(.type == \"user\") | {id, name}' Transform JSON structure cat data.json | jq '.items[] | {name: .name, count: .details.count}' Filter and aggregate cat events.jsonl | jq -s 'group_by(.category) | map({category: .[0].category, count: length})'Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` JMESPath Queries JMESPath offers a declarative query language to extract and transform data from nested JSON structures without needing verbose code. It\u2019s a neat alternative when you want to quickly pull out specific values or filter collections based on conditions. Example: Extracting user emails or filtering out inactive records from a complex JSON payload received from a cloud service. ``` import jmespath Example queries data = { \"locations\": [ {\"name\": \"Seattle\", \"state\": \"WA\", \"info\": {\"population\": 737015}}, {\"name\": \"Portland\", \"state\": \"OR\", \"info\": {\"population\": 652503}} ] } Find all cities with population > 700000 cities = jmespath.search(\"locations[?info.population > 700000].name\", data)Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Streaming with ijson Loading huge JSON files all at once can quickly exhaust system memory. ijson lets you stream and process JSON incrementally.

This method is ideal when your JSON file is too large or when you only need to work with part of the data. Example: Processing a continuous feed from an API that returns a large JSON array, such as sensor data or event logs, while filtering on the fly. ``` import ijson async def process_large_json(filepath: str) -> list: \"\"\"Process a large JSON file without loading it entirely into memory.\"\"\" results = [] with open(filepath, 'rb') as file: # Stream objects under the 'items' key parser = ijson.items(file, 'items.item') async for item in parser: if item['value'] > 100: # Process conditionally results.append(item) return resultsCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Pandas JSON Columns Pandas makes it easy to work with tabular data that includes JSON strings. When you receive API data where one column holds nested JSON, flattening these structures lets you analyze and visualize the data using familiar DataFrame operations. Example: Flattening customer records stored as nested JSON in a CSV file to extract demographic details and spending patterns. ``` import pandas as pd Parse JSON strings in a column df = pd.DataFrame({'json_col': ['{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}', '{\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25}']}) df['parsed'] = df['json_col'].apply(pd.json_normalize) Normalize nested JSON columns df = pd.read_csv('data.csv') df_normalized = pd.json_normalize( df['nested_json'].apply(json.loads), record_path=['items'], # List of nested objects to unpack meta=['id', 'timestamp'] # Keep these columns from parent )Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` SQL JSON Functions SQL supports built-in JSON functions allow you to query and manipulate JSON stored within relational databases. These are implemented by most popular databases, including SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. This is especially handy when you have a hybrid data model, combining structured tables with semi-structured JSON columns. Example: An application that stores user settings or application logs as JSON in a SQLite database, enabling quick lookups and modifications without external JSON parsing libraries. SELECT json_extract(data, '$.name') as name, json_extract(data, '$.details.age') as age FROM users WHERE json_extract(data, '$.active') = trueCopy to clipboardErrorCopied DuckDB JSON Processing DuckDB shines when analyzing JSON/JSONL files directly, making it a powerful tool for data analytics without the overhead of loading entire datasets into memory. Its SQL-like syntax simplifies exploratory analysis on nested data. Example: Performing ad-hoc analytics on streaming JSON logs from a web service, such as calculating average response times or aggregating user behavior metrics. SELECT json_extract_string(data, '$.user.name') as name, avg(json_extract_float(data, '$.metrics.value')) as avg_value FROM read_json_auto('data/*.jsonl') GROUP BY 1 HAVING avg_value > 100Copy to clipboardErrorCopied [Previous Profiling Data with Python](#/profiling-data-with-python) [Next Data Transformation with dbt](#/dbt)",

Background You are a clever student who has joined IIT Madras\u2019 Online Degree in Data Science. You have just enrolled in the Tools in Data Science course. Out of kindness for your teaching assistants, you have decided to build an API that can automatically answer student questions on their behalf based on: Course content with content for TDS Jan 2025 as on 15 Apr 2025. TDS Discourse posts with content from 1 Jan 2025 - 14 Apr 2025. Scrape the data To make sure you can answer these questions, you will need to extract the data from the above source. Create an API Your application exposes an API endpoint. You may host it anywhere. Let\u2019s assume it\u2019s at https://app.example.com/api/. The endpoint must accept a POST request, e.g. POST https://app.example.com/api/ with a student question as well as optional base64 file attachments as JSON.

One of the best ways to approach prompt engineering is to think of LLMs as a smart colleague (with amnesia) who needs explicit instructions. The most authoritative guides are from the LLM providers themselves: Anthropic Google OpenAI Here are some best practices: Use prompt optimizers They rewrite your prompt to improve it. Explore: Anthropic Prompt Optimizer OpenAI Prompt Generation Google AI-powered prompt writing tools Be clear, direct, and detailed Be explicit and thorough. Include all necessary context, goals, and details so the model understands the full picture. BAD: Explain gravitation lensing. (Reason: Vague and lacks context or detail.) GOOD: Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it\u2019s observed and its significance in astronomy. (Reason: Specifies the audience, scope, and focus.) When you ask a question, don\u2019t be vague. Spell it out. Give every detail the listener needs. The clearer you are, the better the answer you\u2019ll get. For example, don\u2019t just say, Explain Gravitation Lensing. Say, Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it\u2019s observed and its significance in astronomy. Anthropic | OpenAI | Google Give examples Provide 2-3 relevant examples to guide the model on the style, structure, or format you expect. This helps the model produce outputs consistent with your desired style. BAD: Explain how to tie a bow tie. (Reason: No examples or reference points given.) GOOD: Explain how to tie a bow tie. For example: To tie a shoelace, you cross the laces and pull them tight\u2026 To tie a necktie, you place it around the collar and loop it through\u2026 Now, apply a similar step-by-step style to describe how to tie a bow tie. (Reason: Provides clear examples and a pattern to follow.) Give examples to the model. If you want someone to build a house, show them a sketch. Don\u2019t just say \u2018build something.\u2019 Giving examples is like showing a pattern. It makes everything easier to follow. Anthropic | OpenAI | Google Think step by step Instruct the model to reason through the problem step by step. This leads to more logical, well-structured answers. BAD: Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied? (Reason: No prompt for structured reasoning.) GOOD: Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied? Think step by step. (Reason: Directly instructs the model to break down reasoning into steps.) Ask the model to think step by step. Don\u2019t ask the model to just give the final answer right away. That\u2019s like asking someone to answer with the first thing that pops into their head. Instead, ask them to break down their thought process into simple moves \u2014 like showing each rung of a ladder as they climb. For example, when thinking step by step, the model could, A, list each customer question, B, find out if it was addressed,",

For example, when thinking step by step, the model could, A, list each customer question, B, find out if it was addressed, and C, decide that the agent answered only 2 out of the 3 questions. Anthropic | OpenAI | Google Assign a role Specify a role or persona for the model. This provides context and helps tailor the response style. BAD: Explain how to fix a software bug. (Reason: No role or perspective given.) GOOD: You are a seasoned software engineer. Explain how to fix a software bug in legacy code, including the debugging and testing process. (Reason: Assigns a clear, knowledgeable persona, guiding the style and depth.) Tell the model who they are. Maybe they\u2019re a seasoned software engineer fixing a legacy bug, or an experienced copy editor revising a publication. By clearly telling the model who they are, you help them speak with just the right expertise and style. Suddenly, your explanation sounds like it\u2019s coming from a true specialist, not a random voice. Anthropic | OpenAI | Google Use XML to structure your prompt Use XML tags to separate different parts of the prompt clearly. This helps the model understand structure and requirements. BAD: Here\u2019s what I want: Provide a summary and then an example. (Reason: Unstructured, no clear separation of tasks.) GOOD: <instructions> Provide a summary of the concept of machine learning. </instructions> <example> Then provide a simple, concrete example of a machine learning application (e.g., an email spam filter). </example>Copy to clipboardErrorCopied (Reason: Uses XML tags to clearly distinguish instructions from examples.) Think of your request like a box. XML tags are neat little labels on that box. They help keep parts sorted, so nothing gets lost in the shuffle. Anthropic | OpenAI | Google Use Markdown to format your output Encourage the model to use Markdown for headings, lists, code blocks, and other formatting features to produce structured, easily readable answers. BAD: Give me the steps in plain text. (Reason: No specific formatting instructions, less readable.) GOOD: Provide the steps in a markdown-formatted list with ### headings for each section and numbered bullet points. (Reason: Directly instructs to use Markdown formatting, making output more structured and clear.) BAD: Correct the spelling and show the corrections. (Reason: No specific formatting instructions) GOOD: Correct the spelling, showing additions and deletions. (Reason: Directly instructs to use HTML formatting, making output more structured and clear.) Markdown is a simple formatting language that all models understand. You can have them add neat headings, sections, bold highlights, and bullet points. These make complex documents more scannable and easy on the eyes. Use JSON for machine-readable output When you need structured data, ask for a JSON-formatted response. This ensures the output is machine-readable and organized. BAD: Just list the items. (Reason: Unstructured plain text makes parsing harder.) GOOD: ``` Organize as an",

GOOD: ``` Organize as an array of objects in a JSON format, like this: json [ { \"name\": \"Item 1\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 1\" }, { \"name\": \"Item 2\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 2\" }, { \"name\": \"Item 3\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 3\" } ]Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` (Reason: Instructing JSON format ensures structured, machine-readable output.) Note: Always use JSON schema if possible. JSON schema is a way to describe the structure of JSON data. An easy way to get the JSON schema is to give ChatGPT sample output and ask it to generate the schema. Imagine you\u2019re organizing data for a big project. Plain text is like dumping everything into one messy pile \u2014 it\u2019s hard to find what you need later. JSON, on the other hand, is like packing your data into neat, labeled boxes within boxes. Everything has its place: fields like \u2018name,\u2019 \u2018description,\u2019 and \u2018value\u2019 make the data easy to read, especially for machines. For example, instead of just listing items, you can structure them as a JSON array, with each item as an object. That way, when you hand it to a program, it\u2019s all clear and ready to use. Prefer Yes/No answers Convert rating or percentage questions into Yes/No queries. LLMs handle binary choices better than numeric scales. BAD: On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that this method works? (Reason: Asks for a numeric rating, which can be imprecise.) GOOD: Is this method likely to work as intended? Please give a reasoning and then answer Yes or No. (Reason: A binary question simplifies the response and clarifies what\u2019s being asked.) Don\u2019t ask \u2018On a scale of one to five\u2026\u2019. Models are not good with numbers. They don\u2019t know how to grade something 7 versus 8 on a 10 point scale. \u2018Yes or no?\u2019 is simple. It\u2019s clear. It\u2019s quick. So, break your question into simple parts that they can answer with just a yes or a no. Ask for reason first, then the answer Instruct the model to provide its reasoning steps before stating the final answer. This makes it less likely to justify itself and more likely to think deeper, leading to more accurate results. BAD: What is the best route to take? (Reason: Direct question without prompting reasoning steps first.) GOOD: First, explain your reasoning step by step for how you determine the best route. Then, after you\u2019ve reasoned it out, state your final recommendation for the best route. (Reason: Forces the model to show its reasoning process before giving the final answer.) BEFORE making its final choice, have the model talk through their thinking. Reasoning first, answer second. That way, the model won\u2019t be tempted to justify an answer that they",

They\u2019re perfect for small web tools that don\u2019t need to run all the time. Here are some common real-life uses: A contact form that emails you when someone wants to hire you (runs for 2-3 seconds, a few times per day) A tool that converts uploaded photos to black and white (runs for 5-10 seconds when someone uploads a photo) A chatbot that answers basic questions about your business hours (runs for 1-2 seconds per question) A newsletter sign-up that adds emails to your mailing list (runs for 1 second per sign-up) A webhook that posts your Etsy sales to Discord (runs for 1 second whenever you make a sale) You only pay when someone uses your tool, and the platform automatically handles busy periods. For example, if 100 people fill out your contact form at once, the platform creates 100 temporary copies of your code to handle them all. When they\u2019re done, these copies disappear. It\u2019s cheaper than running a full-time server because you\u2019re not paying for the time when no one is using your tool - most tools are idle 95% of the time! Rather than writing a full program, serverless platforms let you write functions. These functions are called via HTTP requests. They run in a cloud environment and are scaled up and down automatically. But this means you write programs in a different style. For example: You can\u2019t pip install packages - you have to use requirements.txt You can\u2019t read or write files from the file system - you can only use APIs. You can\u2019t run commands (e.g. subprocess.run()) Vercel is a cloud platform optimized for frontend frameworks and serverless functions. Vercel is tightly integrated with GitHub. Pushing to your repository automatically triggers new deployments. Here\u2019s a quickstart. Sign-up with Vercel. Create an empty git repo with this api/index.py file. To deploy a FastAPI app, add a requirements.txt file with fastapi as a dependency. fastapiCopy to clipboardErrorCopied Add your FastAPI code to a file, e.g. main.py. ``` main.py from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI() @app.get(\"/\") def read_root(): return {\"message\": \"Hello, World!\"}Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Add a vercel.json file to the root of your repository. { \"builds\": [{ \"src\": \"main.py\", \"use\": \"@vercel/python\" }], \"routes\": [{ \"src\": \"/(.*)\", \"dest\": \"main.py\" }] }Copy to clipboardErrorCopied On the command line, run: npx vercel to deploy a test version npx vercel --prod to deploy to production Environment Variables. Use npx vercel env add to add environment variables. In your code, use os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY') to access them.

Or see garbage when you load a CSV file? This video explains why. It covers how computers store text (called character encoding) and why it sometimes goes wonky. Learn about ASCII (the original 7-bit encoding system that could only handle 128 characters), why that wasn\u2019t enough for global languages, and how modern solutions like Unicode save the day by letting us use any character from any language. Some programs try to guess encodings (sometimes badly!). A signature called BOM (Byte Order Mark)helps computers know exactly how to read text files correctly. Learn how Unicode, UTF-8 and character encoding works. This is a common gotcha when building apps that handle international text - something bootcamps often skip but developers and data scientists regularly face in the real world. Unicode is fundamental for data scientists working with international data. Here are key concepts you need to understand: Character Encodings: Different ways to represent text in computers ASCII (7-bit): Limited to 128 characters, English-only UTF-8: Variable-width encoding, backwards compatible with ASCII UTF-16: Fixed-width encoding, used in Windows and Java UTF-32: Fixed-width encoding, memory inefficient but simple Common encoding issues you\u2019ll encounter: ``` Reading files with explicit encoding with open('file.txt', encoding='utf-8') as f: text = f.read() Handling encoding errors import pandas as pd df = pd.read_csv('data.csv', encoding='utf-8', errors='replace') Detecting file encoding import chardet with open('unknown.txt', 'rb') as f: result = chardet.detect(f.read()) print(result['encoding'])Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` [Previous JavaScript tools: npx](#/npx) [Next Browser: DevTools](#/devtools)",

Use vector databases when your embeddings exceed available memory or when you want it run fast at scale. (This is important. If your code runs fast and fits in memory, you DON\u2019T need a vector database. You can can use numpy for these tasks.) Vector databases are an evolving space. The first generation of vector databases were written in C and typically used an algorithm called HNSW (a way to approximately find the nearest neighbor).

(youtube.com) Playwright offers: JavaScript rendering: Executes page scripts so you scrape only after content appears. (playwright.dev) Headless & headed modes: Run without UI or in a real browser for debugging. (playwright.dev) Auto\u2011waiting & retry: Built\u2011in locators reduce flakiness. (playwright.dev) Multi\u2011browser support: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit\u2014all from one API. (playwright.dev) Example: Scraping a JS\u2011Rendered Site We\u2019ll scrape Quotes to Scrape (JS)\u2014a site that loads quotes via JavaScript, so a simple requests call gets only an empty shell (quotes.toscrape.com). Playwright runs the scripts and gives us the real content: ``` /// script dependencies = [\"playwright\"] /// from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright def scrape_quotes(): with sync_playwright() as p: # Channel can be \"chrome\", \"msedge\", \"chrome-beta\", \"msedge-beta\" or \"msedge-dev\". browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True, channel=\"chrome\") page = browser.new_page() page.goto(\"https://quotes.toscrape.com/js/\") quotes = page.query_selector_all(\".quote\") for q in quotes: text = q.query_selector(\".text\").inner_text() author = q.query_selector(\".author\").inner_text() print(f\"{text} \u2014 {author}\") browser.close() if name == \"main\": scrape_quotes()Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Save as scraper.py and run: uv run scraper.pyCopy to clipboardErrorCopied You\u2019ll see each quote plus author printed\u2014fetched only after the JS executes.

It\u2019s fast, easy to use, and designed for building production-ready REST APIs. Here\u2019s a minimal FastAPI app, app.py: ``` /// script requires-python = \">=3.11\" dependencies = [ \"fastapi\", \"uvicorn\", ] /// from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI() @app.get(\"/\") async def root(): return {\"message\": \"Hello!\"} if name == \"main\": import uvicorn uvicorn.run(app, host=\"0.0.0.0\", port=8000)Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Run this with uv run app.py. Handle errors by raising HTTPException ``` from fastapi import HTTPException async def get_item(item_id: int): if not valid_item(item_id): raise HTTPException( status_code=404, detail=f\"Item {item_id} not found\" )Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` 2. Use middleware for logging ``` from fastapi import Request import time @app.middleware(\"http\") async def add_timing(request: Request, call_next): start = time.time() response = await call_next(request) response.headers[\"X-Process-Time\"] = str(time.time() - start) return responseCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Tools: FastAPI CLI: Project scaffolding Pydantic: Data validation SQLModel: SQL databases FastAPI Users: Authentication Watch this FastAPI Course for Beginners (64 min): [Previous REST APIs](#/rest-apis) [Next Authentication: Google Auth](#/google-auth)",

Keyword Search: Use the search function to find Wikipedia pages containing a specific keyword, limiting results with the results argument. Fetching Summaries: Use the summary function to get a concise summary of a Wikipedia page, limiting sentences with the sentences argument. Retrieving Full Pages: Use the page function to obtain the full content of a Wikipedia page, including sections and references. Accessing URLs: Retrieve the URL of a Wikipedia page using the url attribute of the page object. Extracting References: Use the references attribute to get all reference links from a Wikipedia page. Fetching Images: Access all images on a Wikipedia page via the images attribute, which returns a list of image URLs. Extracting Tables: Use the pandas.read_html function to extract tables from the HTML content of a Wikipedia page, being mindful of table indices.
